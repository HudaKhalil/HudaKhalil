## ✨ A Bit More About Me

- 🔍 I love turning messy real-world problems (like feeling unsafe walking home) into clear UX flows and working software.
- 🧪 Comfortable working end-to-end: research → design → implementation → testing.
- 🤝 Open to collaborations on UX-focused web apps, mapping/routing tools, and safety / accessibility projects.
